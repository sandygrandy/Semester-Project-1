            <h3>Cosmology</h3>
            <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 'The Sky Above Us', explores the night sky and what 
                we can see and know about the universe around us. We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can 
                be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar 
                exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo's telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar 
                system.</p>

            <h3>Evolution</h3>
            <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do we come from and 
                how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and understanding 
                our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our 
                time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the 
                Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

            <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
            <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique insights into the great 
                wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and their quality of life much improved, 
                thanks to the growth of our understanding of medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and 
                take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our 
                great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow 
                creatures have beat us to it.</p>

            <h3>Ecology</h3>
            <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it becomes that scientists 
                explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole planet. In our ecology section of the 
                museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we 
                also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>
